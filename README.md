# LetsMakeProject
ProjectOne 
This was a group project. It is the final answer to these questions: With your group, answer each of the following questions:
Who is your target audience?
People looking for things to do in their area.
What is the problem that the product will address?
Most event sites show events and link to external sites to show directions in a seperate browser window.
What is the primary goal of the product?
To allow users to access a single site to find local events and directions. 
Our plan is to have our site show the event and directions simultaneously in a single browser window. 
As a user, I want to quickly and conveniently find something to do on a Saturday night to escape my children. 
As a user, I want to find out what events are happening near my current location. 
As a user, I want to have a resource where I can find events and directions without searching multiple sites.
